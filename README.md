# Kevlar
A flexible, memory safe, and performant high level programming langauge \
(Still work in progress) \
\
This repository soly consist of documentation for Kevlar's syntax and standard library (not here yet) \
For compiler, see [Polymerizer](https://github.com/BlackFuffey/Polymerizer)

Please note this is highly incomplete and some design decisions may change.

## Why Kevlar?
 - **Ease of use**: Kevlar is designed to be concise, straightforward, and flexible. You can take advantage of the high-level
                    functionalities to make performant prototypes, or express low level logic with concise syntax.  
 - **Memory safe**: Kevlar ensures memory safety through a content ID memory management system. This allows the langauge to
                    abstract away memory management while keeping good performance.
